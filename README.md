🚀 **Project Completed: Sign Language Converter using OpenCV & Python** 🚀

I'm excited to share that I’ve developed a **Sign Language Converter** using **OpenCV** and **Python**. This project leverages real-time video processing to recognize and interpret sign language gestures, making communication more accessible for the hearing-impaired community.

🔍 **Key Features:**
- **Hand Gesture Detection** using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Real-time Processing** to convert gestures into corresponding text.
- **Machine Learning Models** for accurate sign recognition.
- **User-friendly Interface** built for easy interaction and conversion.

💡 **Technology Stack**: OpenCV, Python, MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and more.

This project taught me a lot about computer vision, gesture recognition, and how technology can bridge communication gaps. I’m excited to explore more such opportunities in AI-driven accessibility solutions!
